# HospitalPlanner
The "Hospital Planner" project represents a complex endeavor developed within the "Advanced Programming - Java" course. It was created by a two-person team and aims to build a medical appointment planner. The design and implementation focused on two types of scheduling: emergency scheduling, where patients are allocated to the first available doctor, and regular scheduling, where patients express their preferences regarding doctors and the maximum time interval for appointments.

Within this project, I held a significant role in structuring and developing key components, rigorously adhering to the SOLID principles in Java. I created the "Users," "Agenda," and "Appointments" classes, applying these principles to ensure a robust and maintainable architecture. Additionally, I developed both the user interface and the networking part of the application, allowing simultaneous login of multiple patients and doctors. The "Hospital Planner" project showcases my knowledge in advanced Java programming, teamwork skills, and the implementation of a solid and efficient design.
